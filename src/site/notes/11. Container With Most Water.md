> [!Problem]
> You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `ith` line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.
> 
> Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.
> 
> Return _the maximum amount of water a container can store_.
> 
> **Notice** that you may not slant the container.
> 
> **Example 1:**
> 
> ![](https://s3-lc-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/07/17/question_11.jpg)
> 
> **Input:** height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
> **Output:** 49
> **Explanation:** The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
> 
> **Example 2:**
> 
> **Input:** height = [1,1]
> **Output:** 1
> 
> **Constraints:**
> 
> - `n == height.length`
> - `2 <= n <= 105`
> - `0 <= height[i] <= 104`
# Intuition
- From the figure, it is clear that taller edges in the middle do not affect the walls
- So we can be greedy
- Two pointer style solution, one for either end
- The pointer should move based on comparison of which is current tallest side, rather than which side has next tallest
- We want to retain the current tallest to get more volume, not lose it and move to second best
# Solution
- **Time Complexity**: $O(n)$
- **Space Complexity**: $O(1)$
```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        max_area: int = 0
        i: int = 0
        j: int = len(height) - 1

        while i < j:
            max_area = max(max_area, (j - i) * min(height[i], height[j]))

            if height[i] < height[j]:
                i += 1
            else:
                j -= 1
        
        return max_area
```
