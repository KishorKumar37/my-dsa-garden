>[!Problem]
>A conveyor belt has packages that must be shipped from one port to another within `days` days.
> The `ith` package on the conveyor belt has a weight of `weights[i]`. Each day, we load the ship with packages on the conveyor belt (in the order given by `weights`). We may not load more weight than the maximum weight capacity of the ship.
> 
> Return the least weight capacity of the ship that will result in all the packages on the conveyor belt being shipped within `days` days.
> 
> **Example 1:**
> 
> **Input:** weights = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], days = 5
> **Output:** 15
> **Explanation:** A ship capacity of 15 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 5 days like this:
> 1st day: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
> 2nd day: 6, 7
> 3rd day: 8
> 4th day: 9
> 5th day: 10
> 
> Note that the cargo must be shipped in the order given, so using a ship of capacity 14 and splitting the packages into parts like (2, 3, 4, 5), (1, 6, 7), (8), (9), (10) is not allowed.
> 
> **Example 2:**
> 
> **Input:** weights = [3,2,2,4,1,4], days = 3
> **Output:** 6
> **Explanation:** A ship capacity of 6 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 3 days like this:
> 1st day: 3, 2
> 2nd day: 2, 4
> 3rd day: 1, 4
> 
> **Example 3:**
> 
> **Input:** weights = [1,2,3,1,1], days = 4
> **Output:** 3
> **Explanation:**
> 1st day: 1
> 2nd day: 2
> 3rd day: 3
> 4th day: 1, 1
> 
> **Constraints:**
> 
> - `1 <= days <= weights.length <= 5 * 104`
> - `1 <= weights[i] <= 500`

# Solution
- **Time Complexity**: $O(\log{sum(w)})$
- **Space Complexity**: $O(1)$
## Intuition
- The problem is basically to create $d$ contiguous groups (days) in the weights such that the capacity required is minimum
- There is no direct way, we have to search over space of possible capacities
- The absolute minimum capacity, regardless of days constraint, is max(weights) which will take $days~needed \geq days~given$
- The maximum capacity possible is sum(weights), which will take $days~needed = 1$
- We can search in this space using Binary Search
- With capacity $m$, test the number of $days~needed$
- It is important to note that $days~needed = days~given$ can be satisfied by multiple $m$'s and we need to find the smallest such $m$
- So, we don't check for equals condition in Binary Search
- The necessary modifications are
	- while loop runs in $<$ instead of $\leq$
	- $r$ becomes $m$ instead of $m - 1$
	- we don't check equality condition or return $m$, we return $l$ once while loop ends
```python
class Solution:
    def shipWithinDays(self, weights: List[int], days: int) -> int:
        l = max(weights)
        r = sum(weights)

        while l <= r:
            m = l + ((r - l) // 2)
            loaded = 0
            days_needed = 1
            for weight in weights:
                if loaded + weight > m:
                    days_needed += 1
                    loaded = 0
                loaded += weight

            if days_needed <= days:
                weight_capacity = m
                r = m - 1
            else:
                l = m + 1
        return weight_capacity
