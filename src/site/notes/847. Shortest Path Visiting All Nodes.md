>[!Problem]
>You have an undirected, connected graph of `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`. You are given an array `graph` where `graph[i]` is a list of all the nodes connected with node `i` by an edge.
> Return _the length of the shortest path that visits every node_. You may start and stop at any node, you may revisit nodes multiple times, and you may reuse edges.
> 
> **Example 1:**
> 
> ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/12/shortest1-graph.jpg)
> 
> **Input:** graph = [[1,2,3],[0],[0],[0\|1,2,3],[0],[0],[0]]
> **Output:** 4
> **Explanation:** One possible path is [1,0,2,0,3]
> 
> **Example 2:**
> 
> ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/12/shortest2-graph.jpg)
> 
> **Input:** graph = [[1],[0,2,4],[1,3,4],[2],[1,2\|1],[0,2,4],[1,3,4],[2],[1,2]]
> **Output:** 4
> **Explanation:** One possible path is [0,1,4,2,3]
> 
> **Constraints:**
> 
> - `n == graph.length`
> - `1 <= n <= 12`
> - `0 <= graph[i].length < n`
> - `graph[i]` does not contain `i`.
> - If `graph[a]` contains `b`, then `graph[b]` contains `a`.
> - The input graph is always connected.

# Intuition

# Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def shortestPathLength(self, graph: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        n = len(graph)
        queue = deque([(1 << i, i, 0) for i in range(n)]) # (mask, node, dist)
        visited = set((1 << i, i) for i in range(n))

        while queue:
            mask, node, dist = queue.popleft()
            if mask == (1 << n) - 1:
                return dist
            
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                new_mask = mask | (1 << neighbor)
                if (new_mask, neighbor) not in visited:
                    visited.add((new_mask, neighbor))
                    queue.append((new_mask, neighbor, dist + 1))
