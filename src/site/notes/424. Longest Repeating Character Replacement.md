# Solution
- **Time Complexity**: $O(n)$
- **Space Complexity**: $O(n)$
## Intuition
- At first glance, it might seem similar to [[3434. Maximum Frequency After Subarray Operation\|3434. Maximum Frequency After Subarray Operation]]
- The difference is that we choose $k$ characters and change them into anything we want, so instead of operating on the frequent elements like [[3434. Maximum Frequency After Subarray Operation\|3434. Maximum Frequency After Subarray Operation]], we operate on the elements remaining in substring
- We create a 2 pointer style moving window loop, the window represents the substring being considered
- The cost of replacement to make the entire substring as repeated characters is it's length - most frequent character count
- If replacement cost is within $k$, we will update the max substring length with this contender
- If not, we need to move the left side of the window by 1 and update count in dict accordingly
- The main trick here is that the most frequent character count does not need to be calculated each time. Even though the count changes when we move left side of window because replacement cost was higher, the replacement cost can be brought down only by substring length and not the most frequent character count
- So we can maintain it as the most frequent character count seen so far
```python
class Solution:
    def characterReplacement(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        l = 0

        count = defaultdict(int)

        max_substring_length = 0
        max_count = 0

        for r in range(len(s)):
            count[s[r]] += 1
            substring_length = (r - l + 1)
            max_count = max(max_count, count[s[r]])

            replacement_cost = substring_length - max_count

            if replacement_cost <= k:
                max_substring_length = max(substring_length, max_substring_length)
            else:
                count[s[l]] -= 1
                l += 1
        
        return max_substring_length
```
