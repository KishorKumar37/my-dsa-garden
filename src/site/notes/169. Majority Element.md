>[!Problem]
>Given an array `nums` of size `n`, return _the majority element_.
> The majority element is the element that appears more than `⌊n / 2⌋` times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.
> 
> **Example 1:**
> 
> **Input:** nums = [3,2,3]
> **Output:** 3
> 
> **Example 2:**
> 
> **Input:** nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
> **Output:** 2
> 
> **Constraints:**
> 
> - `n == nums.length`
> - `1 <= n <= 5 * 104`
> - `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
> 
> **Follow-up:** Could you solve the problem in linear time and in `O(1)` space?

# Intuition
- Brute force would be to bucket sort and get the largest
- The trick lies in the fact that this element constitutes more than half of the array, so we can use a greedy strategy
- If all the elements voted for themselves one by one, and we counter a vote for another candidate as negative to reset at zero votes and consider a new number as candidate
- The majority elements will always outvote every other element
# Solution
- **Time Complexity**: $O(n)$
- **Space Complexity**: $O(1)$
```python
class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # counter = Counter(nums)
        # return counter.most_common(1)[0][0]

        votes = 0
        candidate = None

        for num in nums:
            if not votes:
                candidate = num
                votes += 1
            elif num != candidate:
                votes -= 1
            else:
                votes += 1

        return candidate
```
