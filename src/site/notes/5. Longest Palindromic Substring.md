> [!Problem]
> Given a string `s`, return _the longest_ _palindromic_ _substring_ in `s`.
> 
> **Example 1:**
> 
> **Input:** s = "babad"
> **Output:** "bab"
> **Explanation:** "aba" is also a valid answer.
> 
> **Example 2:**
> 
> **Input:** s = "cbbd"
> **Output:** "bb"
> 
> **Constraints:**
> 
> - `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
> - `s` consist of only digits and English letters.

# Intuition
- Brute force would be a $O(n^2)$ nested loop, wrapped around a $O(n)$ palindrome checking function giving $O(n^3)$
- In the nested loop, there will be some sub-strings that will be overlapping with others at different points, which indicates we need to use DP
- DP is 2D, start and end of sub-string
- For DP, always use a reverse nested loop ie: outer loop is endpoint and inner loop is starting point, so that DP's memo is built properly
- Palindrome condition becomes checking ends of substring and then checking DP for remaining part

# Solution
- **Time Complexity**: $O(n^2)$
- **Space Complexity**: $O(n^2)$
```python
class Solution:
    def longestPalindrome(self, s: str) -> str:
        if len(s) <= 1:
            return s
        dp = [[False for _ in range(len(s))] for _ in range(len(s))]

        for i in range(len(s)):
            dp[i][i] = True
        
        max_len = 1
        max_str = s[0]
        
        for j in range(1, len(s)):
            for i in range(j):
                if s[i] == s[j] and (j - i <= 2 or dp[i + 1][j - 1]):
                    dp[i][j] = True
                
                    str_len = j - i + 1
                    if str_len > max_len:
                        max_len = str_len
                        max_str = s[i:j + 1]
        
        return max_str
```
