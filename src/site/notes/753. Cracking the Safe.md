>[!Problem]
>There is a safe protected by a password. The password is a sequence of `n` digits where each digit can be in the range `[0, k - 1]`.
> The safe has a peculiar way of checking the password. When you enter in a sequence, it checks the **most recent** `n` **digits** that were entered each time you type a digit.
> 
> - For example, the correct password is `"345"` and you enter in `"012345"`:
>     - After typing `0`, the most recent `3` digits is `"0"`, which is incorrect.
>     - After typing `1`, the most recent `3` digits is `"01"`, which is incorrect.
>     - After typing `2`, the most recent `3` digits is `"012"`, which is incorrect.
>     - After typing `3`, the most recent `3` digits is `"123"`, which is incorrect.
>     - After typing `4`, the most recent `3` digits is `"234"`, which is incorrect.
>     - After typing `5`, the most recent `3` digits is `"345"`, which is correct and the safe unlocks.
> 
> Return _any string of **minimum length** that will unlock the safe **at some point** of entering it_.
> 
> **Example 1:**
> 
> **Input:** n = 1, k = 2
> **Output:** "10"
> **Explanation:** The password is a single digit, so enter each digit. "01" would also unlock the safe.
> 
> **Example 2:**
> 
> **Input:** n = 2, k = 2
> **Output:** "01100"
> **Explanation:** For each possible password:
> - "00" is typed in starting from the 4th digit.
> - "01" is typed in starting from the 1st digit.
> - "10" is typed in starting from the 3rd digit.
> - "11" is typed in starting from the 2nd digit.
> Thus "01100" will unlock the safe. "10011", and "11001" would also unlock the safe.
> 
> **Constraints:**
> 
> - `1 <= n <= 4`
> - `1 <= k <= 10`
> - `1 <= kn <= 4096`

# Intuition

# Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def crackSafe(self, n: int, k: int) -> str:
        res = "0" * n
        nums = [str(i) for i in range(k - 1, -1, -1)]

        seen = set([res])

        def dfs():
            nonlocal res
            curr = ""
            if n != 1:
                curr = res[-n + 1:]
                
            print(curr)
            for num in nums:
                if curr + num in seen:
                    continue
                res += num
                seen.add(curr + num)
                dfs()
                # return
        
        dfs()
        return res
```
