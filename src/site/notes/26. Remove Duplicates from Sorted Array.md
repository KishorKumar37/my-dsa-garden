> [!Problem]
> Given an integer array `nums` sorted in **non-decreasing order**, remove the duplicates [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) such that each unique element appears only **once**. The **relative order** of the elements should be kept the **same**. Then return _the number of unique elements in_ `nums`.
> 
> Consider the number of unique elements of `nums` to be `k`, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:
> 
> - Change the array `nums` such that the first `k` elements of `nums` contain the unique elements in the order they were present in `nums` initially. The remaining elements of `nums` are not important as well as the size of `nums`.
> - Return `k`.
> 
> **Custom Judge:**
> 
> The judge will test your solution with the following code:
> 
> int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
> int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length
> 
> int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation
> 
> assert k == expectedNums.length;
> for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
>     assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
> }
> 
> If all assertions pass, then your solution will be **accepted**.
> 
> **Example 1:**
> 
> **Input:** nums = [1,1,2]
> **Output:** 2, nums = [1,2,_]
> **Explanation:** Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
> It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
> 
> **Example 2:**
> 
> **Input:** nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
> **Output:** 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
> **Explanation:** Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
> It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
> 
> **Constraints:**
> 
> - `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104`
> - `-100 <= nums[i] <= 100`
> - `nums` is sorted in **non-decreasing** order.

# Intuition
- We can do a two pointer style solution
- Since we want in place, maintain one pointer for correct values stored in array and another for going through existing array
- Update value in main pointer if non-repeating value is encountered
- Fill remaining with zeros if necessary
# Solution
- **Time Complexity**: $O(n)$
- **Space Complexity**: $O(1)$
```python
lass Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        j = 1

        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] != nums[j - 1]:
                nums[j] = nums[i]
                j += 1
        
        return j
```
