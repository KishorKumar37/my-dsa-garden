>[!Problem]
>Given two strings `s` and `t` of lengths `m` and `n` respectively, return _the **minimum window**_ **_substring_** _of_ `s` _such that every character in_ `t` _(**including duplicates**) is included in the window_. If there is no such substring, return _the empty string_ `""`.
> The testcases will be generated such that the answer is **unique**.
> 
> **Example 1:**
> 
> **Input:** s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
> **Output:** "BANC"
> **Explanation:** The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.
> 
> **Example 2:**
> 
> **Input:** s = "a", t = "a"
> **Output:** "a"
> **Explanation:** The entire string s is the minimum window.
> 
> **Example 3:**
> 
> **Input:** s = "a", t = "aa"
> **Output:** ""
> **Explanation:** Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.
> Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.
> 
> **Constraints:**
> 
> - `m == s.length`
> - `n == t.length`
> - `1 <= m, n <= 105`
> - `s` and `t` consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.
> 
> **Follow up:** Could you find an algorithm that runs in `O(m + n)` time?

# Solution
- **Time Complexity**: $O(m + n)$
- **Space Complexity**: $O(m)$
## Intuition
- Substring / window in string always means 2 pointer with both starting from 0
- For this problem, we need to have each character from $t$, repeated that many times
- So we create a counter for $t$ and also another variable to easily check the number of characters remaining
- The right pointer is the character under consideration
	- if it's in $t$, we will decrement number of remaining characters (counter value positive means it's in $t$)
	- we will decrement the counter for all characters, so characters not in $t$ will have negative count
- This above part keeps increasing right pointer until the number of remaining characters is 0
- Then we will try to move the left pointer as much as we can in a while loop, by checking if that character is in $t$ (counter value negative means not in $t$)
- Once this is done, we will compare the current window start and end with this new one for length and update accordingly
- Then we will update left pointer by one again
>[!warning]
>- Remember that the check for a char in $t$ or not is +ve and -ve value of counter respectively, never 0
>- So, even though we always update the counter values, regardless of whether they are in $t$ are not, the characters while are not in $t$ will only be 0 or negative, never positive

class Solution:
    def minWindow(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        if len(s) < len(t):
            return ""

        counter_t = defaultdict(int)
        for char in t:
            counter_t[char] += 1

        l = 0

        chars_remaining = len(t)
        min_window = (0, len(s) + 1)

        for r, char in enumerate(s):
            if counter_t[char] > 0:
                chars_remaining -= 1
            counter_t[char] -= 1
        
            if chars_remaining == 0:
                while counter_t[s[l]] < 0:
                    counter_t[s[l]] += 1
                    l += 1

                if (r - l) < (min_window[1] - min_window[0]):
                    min_window = (l, r)
                
                counter_t[s[l]] += 1
                chars_remaining += 1
                l += 1
                
        if min_window[1] > len(s):
            return ""
        
        return s[min_window[0]: min_window[1] + 1]
