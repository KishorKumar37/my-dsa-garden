>[!Problem]
>Given an unsorted integer array `nums`. Return the _smallest positive integer_ that is _not present_ in `nums`.
> You must implement an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time and uses `O(1)` auxiliary space.
> 
> **Example 1:**
> 
> **Input:** nums = [1,2,0]
> **Output:** 3
> **Explanation:** The numbers in the range [1,2] are all in the array.
> 
> **Example 2:**
> 
> **Input:** nums = [3,4,-1,1]
> **Output:** 2
> **Explanation:** 1 is in the array but 2 is missing.
> 
> **Example 3:**
> 
> **Input:** nums = [7,8,9,11,12]
> **Output:** 1
> **Explanation:** The smallest positive integer 1 is missing.
> 
> **Constraints:**
> 
> - `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
> - `-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1`

# Intuition
- Brute force requires sorting in $O(n \log{n})$ first and then checking which positive number is not present
- The idea is that: $n$ numbers, if all are present in the array, can be placed in the first $n$ indices correctly without gaps
- If the numbers in the array are made to follow the above rule, then numbers which are greater than $0$ should be placed such that $$nums[i] = nums[nums[i] - 1]$$
- We will step through the numbers one by one and if we encounter a positive integer that is not in it's correct position, we will swap it with it's correct place
- Note that this swapping needs to be done in a loop until all elements that come to current index through swap are in right position or are not positive integer (this loop is not a function of $n$, hence does not contribute to time complexity)
- Finally, run through the loop again to see if any number does not follow this condition, the index is the missing number

# Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def firstMissingPositive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)

        for i in range(n):
            while 0 < nums[i] <= n and nums[i] != nums[nums[i] - 1]:
                nums[nums[i] - 1], nums[i] = nums[i], nums[nums[i] - 1]
        
        for i in range(0, n):
            if nums[i] != i + 1:
                return i + 1
        
        return n + 1
```
