> [!NOTE]
> A **path** in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence **at most once**. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.
> 
> The **path sum** of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.
> 
> Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the maximum **path sum** of any **non-empty** path_.
> 
> **Example 1:**
> 
> ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/13/exx1.jpg)
> 
> **Input:** root = [1,2,3]
> **Output:** 6
> **Explanation:** The optimal path is 2 -> 1 -> 3 with a path sum of 2 + 1 + 3 = 6.
> 
> **Example 2:**
> 
> ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/13/exx2.jpg)
> 
> **Input:** root = [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]
> **Output:** 42
> **Explanation:** The optimal path is 15 -> 20 -> 7 with a path sum of 15 + 20 + 7 = 42.
> 
> **Constraints:**
> 
> - The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 3 * 104]`.
> - `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`

# Intuition

# Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def maxPathSum(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        maxPath = float("-inf")
        
        def dfs(root):
            nonlocal maxPath
            if not root:
                return 0
            
            leftPath = dfs(root.left) + root.val
            rightPath = dfs(root.right) + root.val
            fullPath = leftPath + rightPath - root.val

            maxPath = max(maxPath, leftPath, rightPath, fullPath, root.val)

            return max(leftPath, rightPath, root.val)
        
        dfs(root)
        
        return maxPath
```
