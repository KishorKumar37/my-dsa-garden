>[!Problem]
>Koko loves to eat bananas. There are `n` piles of bananas, the `ith` pile has `piles[i]` bananas. The guards have gone and will come back in `h` hours.
> Koko can decide her bananas-per-hour eating speed of `k`. Each hour, she chooses some pile of bananas and eats `k` bananas from that pile. If the pile has less than `k` bananas, she eats all of them instead and will not eat any more bananas during this hour.
> 
> Koko likes to eat slowly but still wants to finish eating all the bananas before the guards return.
> 
> Return _the minimum integer_ `k` _such that she can eat all the bananas within_ `h` _hours_.
> 
> **Example 1:**
> 
> **Input:** piles = [3,6,7,11], h = 8
> **Output:** 4
> 
> **Example 2:**
> 
> **Input:** piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 5
> **Output:** 30
> 
> **Example 3:**
> 
> **Input:** piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 6
> **Output:** 23
> 
> **Constraints:**
> 
> - `1 <= piles.length <= 104`
> - `piles.length <= h <= 109`
> - `1 <= piles[i] <= 109`

# Solution
- **Time Complexity**: $O(\log{sum(piles)})$
- **Space Complexity**: $O(1)$
## Intuition
- Same as [[1011. Capacity To Ship Packages Within D Days\|1011. Capacity To Ship Packages Within D Days]]
- Modify the inner loop on how to calculate days
- Use ceil function or the method in comment for hours
```python
class Solution:
    def minEatingSpeed(self, piles: List[int], h: int) -> int:

        min_speed = ceil(sum(piles) / h)
        max_speed = max(piles)

        while min_speed <= max_speed:
            speed = min_speed + ((max_speed - min_speed) // 2)

            hours = 0
            for pile in piles:
                hours += ceil(pile / speed)
            
            if hours <= h:
                optimal_speed = speed
                max_speed = speed - 1
            else:
                min_speed = speed + 1
        
        return optimal_speed
```
