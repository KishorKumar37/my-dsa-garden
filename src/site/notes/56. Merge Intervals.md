>[!Problem]
>Given an array of `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, merge all overlapping intervals, and return _an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input_.
> **Example 1:**
> 
> **Input:** intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18\|1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
> **Output:** [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18\|1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
> **Explanation:** Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].
> 
> **Example 2:**
> 
> **Input:** intervals = [[1,4],[4,5\|1,4],[4,5]]
> **Output:** [[1,5\|1,5]]
> **Explanation:** Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.
> 
> **Constraints:**
> 
> - `1 <= intervals.length <= 104`
> - `intervals[i].length == 2`
> - `0 <= starti <= endi <= 104`

# Solution
- **Time Complexity**: $O(n \log{n})$
- **Space Complexity**: $O(1)$
## Intuition
- 2 intervals are overlapping if the end time of one is before the start time of another
- We can be greedy by sorting according to start time of intervals
- Iterate through all intervals
- Keep track of previous interval, if it overlaps update the end time to max of the 2 intervals
- When non-overlapping interval is found, push the previous interval to result array
```python
class Solution:
    def merge(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        if len(intervals) == 1:
            return intervals
    
        intervals = sorted(intervals, key=lambda x: x[0])

        prev_interval = intervals[0]

        result = []

        for i in range(1, len(intervals)):
            current_interval = intervals[i]

            if current_interval[0] <= prev_interval[1]:
                prev_interval[1] = max(prev_interval[1], current_interval[1])
            else:
                result.append(prev_interval)
                prev_interval = current_interval
        
        result.append(prev_interval)
        
        return result
```
