> [!Problem]
> You are given the `root` of a binary search tree (BST), where the values of **exactly** two nodes of the tree were swapped by mistake. _Recover the tree without changing its structure_.
> 
> **Example 1:**
> 
> ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/28/recover1.jpg)
> 
> **Input:** root = [1,3,null,null,2]
> **Output:** [3,1,null,null,2]
> **Explanation:** 3 cannot be a left child of 1 because 3 > 1. Swapping 1 and 3 makes the BST valid.
> 
> **Example 2:**
> 
> ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/28/recover2.jpg)
> 
> **Input:** root = [3,1,4,null,null,2]
> **Output:** [2,1,4,null,null,3]
> **Explanation:** 2 cannot be in the right subtree of 3 because 2 < 3. Swapping 2 and 3 makes the BST valid.
> 
> **Constraints:**
> 
> - The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 1000]`.
> - `-231 <= Node.val <= 231 - 1`
> 
> **Follow up:** A solution using `O(n)` space is pretty straight-forward. Could you devise a constant `O(1)` space solution?

# Intuition

# Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def recoverTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify root in-place instead.
        """
        s = [None, None]
        prev = None

        def dft(root):
            nonlocal prev, s
            if not root:
                return
            # print(root.val)
            dft(root.left)
            
            if prev and root.val <= prev.val:
                s[1] = root
                if not s[0]:
                    s[0] = prev
            prev = root

            dft(root.right)


        dft(root)
        s[0].val, s[1].val = s[1].val, s[0].val
        # print(s)
        return
