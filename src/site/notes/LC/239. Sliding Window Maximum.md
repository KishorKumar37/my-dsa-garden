>[!Problem]
>You are given an array of integers `nums`, there is a sliding window of size `k` which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the `k` numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.
> Return _the max sliding window_.
> 
> **Example 1:**
> 
> **Input:** nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], k = 3
> **Output:** [3,3,5,5,6,7]
> **Explanation:** 
> Window position                Max
> ---------------               -----
> [1  3  -1] -3  5  3  6  7       **3**
>  1 [3  -1  -3] 5  3  6  7       **3**
>  1  3 [-1  -3  5] 3  6  7      ** 5**
>  1  3  -1 [-3  5  3] 6  7       **5**
>  1  3  -1  -3 [5  3  6] 7       **6**
>  1  3  -1  -3  5 [3  6  7]      **7**

> **Example 2:**
> 
> **Input:** nums = [1], k = 1
> **Output:** [1]
> 
> **Constraints:**
> 
> - `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
> - `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`
> - `1 <= k <= nums.length`

# Solution 1: [[Heap\|Heap]]
- **Time Complexity**: $O(n \log{k})$
- **Space Complexity**: $O(k)$

## Intuition
- Brute force require $O(k \log{k})$ to first sort the initial window and then $O(n k)$ to maintain the sort order in removing each previous element and adding new element
- Since we don't actually need order, only need the largest element in each window, we can maintain a max heap
- Max heap uses tuple of (negative of value, index), ordered on the first element
- We can keep popping the top if it is outside the sliding window
- Then add the remaining top of max heap

```python
class Solution:
    def maxSlidingWindow(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        n = len(nums)
        priority_queue = []

        for i in range(0, k):
            heapq.heappush(priority_queue, (-nums[i], i))
        
        i = 1
        j = k

        res = []
        res.append(-priority_queue[0][0])

        while j < n:
            heapq.heappush(priority_queue, (-nums[j], j))
            while priority_queue[0][1] < i:
                heapq.heappop(priority_queue)
            
            res.append(-priority_queue[0][0])

            j += 1
            i += 1

        return res
```

# Solution 2: [[Queue\|Queue]]
- **Time Complexity**: $O(n)$
- **Space Complexity**: $O(k)$

## Intuition
- Priority queue is actually overkill for this since it gives the first $k$ largest elements one-by-one, when we actually only need the largest, just one element, while removing elements outside the sliding window properly
- We can achieve this using a simple queue, the front contains the largest element and on insertion, we pop elements from back that are smaller than current number before inserting it in back
- If the largest element / front of queue is outside the sliding window, we pop it
- Then we get the largest in the window at the front

```python
class Solution:
    def maxSlidingWindow(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        res = []
        queue = deque()

        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            
            while queue and queue[-1] < num:
                queue.pop()
            
            queue.append(num)

            if i >= k and nums[i - k] == queue[0]:
                queue.popleft()
            
            if i >= k - 1:
                res.append(queue[0])
        
        return res
```
