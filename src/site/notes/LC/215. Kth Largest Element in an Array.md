>[!Problem]
>Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return _the_ `kth` _largest element in the array_.
> Note that it is the `kth` largest element in the sorted order, not the `kth` distinct element.
> 
> Can you solve it without sorting?
> 
> **Example 1:**
> 
> **Input:** nums = [3,2,1,5,6,4], k = 2
> **Output:** 5
> 
> **Example 2:**
> 
> **Input:** nums = [3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6], k = 4
> **Output:** 4
> 
> **Constraints:**
> 
> - `1 <= k <= nums.length <= 105`
> - `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`

# Solution 1: Priority Queue with Max [[Heap\|Heap]]
- **Time Complexity**: $O(n + k\log{n})$
- **Space Complexity**: $O(n)$
## Intuition
- Heapify is $O(n)$
- Then get value from it $k$ times

```python
class Solution:
    def findKthLargest(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        
        max_heap = heapq.heapify([-num for num in nums])
        
        while k > 1:
            heapq.heappop(max_heap)
            k -= 1
        
        return -heapq.heappop(max_heap)
```

# Solution 2: Priority Queue with Min [[Heap\|Heap]]
- **Time Complexity**: $O(n \log{k})$
- **Space Complexity**: $O(n)$
## Intuition
- Build a min heap of size $k$
- Push elements if size permits
- If size does not, only push elements that are larger than the top of heap
- This way, the bottom of the heap is largest and top of heap is kth largest
- Since we need to check condition, we can't use heapify and build slowly at $O(n \log{k}$)
- Then the target element is at the top
```python
class Solution:
    def findKthLargest(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        
        min_heap = []

        for num in nums:
            if len(min_heap) < k:
                heapq.heappush(min_heap, num)
                continue
            if num > min_heap[0]:
                heapq.heappushpop(min_heap, num)
        
        return heapq.heappop(min_heap)
```
