>[!Problem]
>You are given a list of airline `tickets` where `tickets[i] = [fromi, toi]` represent the departure and the arrival airports of one flight. Reconstruct the itinerary in order and return it.
> All of the tickets belong to a man who departs from `"JFK"`, thus, the itinerary must begin with `"JFK"`. If there are multiple valid itineraries, you should return the itinerary that has the smallest lexical order when read as a single string.
> 
> - For example, the itinerary `["JFK", "LGA"]` has a smaller lexical order than `["JFK", "LGB"]`.
> 
> You may assume all tickets form at least one valid itinerary. You must use all the tickets once and only once.
> 
> **Example 1:**
> 
> ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/14/itinerary1-graph.jpg)
> 
> **Input:** tickets = [["MUC","LHR"],["JFK","MUC"],["SFO","SJC"],["LHR","SFO"\|"MUC","LHR"],["JFK","MUC"],["SFO","SJC"],["LHR","SFO"]]
> **Output:** ["JFK","MUC","LHR","SFO","SJC"]
> 
> **Example 2:**
> 
> ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/14/itinerary2-graph.jpg)
> 
> **Input:** tickets = [["JFK","SFO"],["JFK","ATL"],["SFO","ATL"],["ATL","JFK"],["ATL","SFO"\|"JFK","SFO"],["JFK","ATL"],["SFO","ATL"],["ATL","JFK"],["ATL","SFO"]]
> **Output:** ["JFK","ATL","JFK","SFO","ATL","SFO"]
> **Explanation:** Another possible reconstruction is ["JFK","SFO","ATL","JFK","ATL","SFO"] but it is larger in lexical order.
> 
> **Constraints:**
> 
> - `1 <= tickets.length <= 300`
> - `tickets[i].length == 2`
> - `fromi.length == 3`
> - `toi.length == 3`
> - `fromi` and `toi` consist of uppercase English letters.
> - `fromi != toi`

# Intuition

# Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def findItinerary(self, tickets: List[List[str]]) -> List[str]:
        graph = defaultdict(list)
        print(sorted(tickets, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True))

        for u, v in sorted(tickets, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True):
            graph[u].append(v)

        itenary = []
        
        stack = ["JFK"]

        while stack:
            if graph[stack[-1]]:
                stack.append(graph[stack[-1]].pop())
            else:
                itenary.append(stack.pop())

        return itenary[::-1]
```
