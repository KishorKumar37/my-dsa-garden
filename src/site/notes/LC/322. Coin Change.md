>[!Problem]
>You are given an integer array `coins` representing coins of different denominations and an integer `amount` representing a total amount of money.
> Return _the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount_. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return `-1`.
> 
> You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.
> 
> **Example 1:**
> 
> **Input:** coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11
> **Output:** 3
> **Explanation:** 11 = 5 + 5 + 1
> 
> **Example 2:**
> 
> **Input:** coins = [2], amount = 3
> **Output:** -1
> 
> **Example 3:**
> 
> **Input:** coins = [1], amount = 0
> **Output:** 0
> 
> **Constraints:**
> 
> - `1 <= coins.length <= 12`
> - `1 <= coins[i] <= 231 - 1`
> - `0 <= amount <= 104`

# Solution
- **Time Complexity**: $O(amount \times coins)$
- **Space Complexity**: $O(amount)$
## Intuition
- Have dp representing min number of coins for amount $i$, initialized to max value (which is amount + 1)
- Iterate through each coin in outer loop
- Inner loop starts with coin as minimum amount and max value
- If using this new coin, reduces the number of coins for the amount, use it
- In the end, if df value for amount is not changed return -1, else return the value
```python
class Solution:
    def coinChange(self, coins: List[int], amount: int) -> int:
        if amount == 0:
            return 0
        dp = [(amount + 1)] * (amount + 1)
        dp[0] = 0

        for coin in coins:
            for i in range(coin, amount + 1):
                dp[i] = min(dp[i],  dp[i - coin] + 1)
        
        if dp[amount] == (amount + 1):
            return -1
        
        return dp[amount]
```
