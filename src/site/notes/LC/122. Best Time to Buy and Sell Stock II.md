>[!Problem]
>You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.
> On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold **at most one** share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the **same day**.
> 
> Find and return _the **maximum** profit you can achieve_.
> 
> **Example 1:**
> 
> **Input:** prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
> **Output:** 7
> **Explanation:** Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
> Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
> Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.
> 
> **Example 2:**
> 
> **Input:** prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
> **Output:** 4
> **Explanation:** Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
> Total profit is 4.
> 
> **Example 3:**
> 
> **Input:** prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
> **Output:** 0
> **Explanation:** There is no way to make a positive profit, so we never buy the stock to achieve the maximum profit of 0.
> 
> **Constraints:**
> 
> - `1 <= prices.length <= 3 * 104`
> - `0 <= prices[i] <= 104`

# Solution
- **Time Complexity**: $O(n)$
- **Space Complexity**: $O(1)$
## Intuition
- We can be greedy here because there are no negative values
- It is similar to the condition of [[Kadane's Algorithm\|Kadane's Algorithm]]
- If prices increases then profit is made, else no downside
- Assume we buy on day 0
- As long as the price is increasing, keep incrementing profit and replace this as buy value
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        max_profit = 0
        holding_value = prices[0]

        for selling_value in prices:
            if holding_value < selling_value:
                max_profit += (selling_value - holding_value)
            holding_value = selling_value
        
        return max_profit
```
