>[!Problem]
>Given the `root` of a **complete** binary tree, return the number of the nodes in the tree.
> According to **[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree#Types_of_binary_trees)**, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled in a complete binary tree, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between `1` and `2h` nodes inclusive at the last level `h`.
> 
> Design an algorithm that runs in less than `O(n)` time complexity.
> 
> **Example 1:**
> 
> ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/14/complete.jpg)
> 
> **Input:** root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
> **Output:** 6
> 
> **Example 2:**
> 
> **Input:** root = []
> **Output:** 0
> 
> **Example 3:**
> 
> **Input:** root = [1]
> **Output:** 1
> 
> **Constraints:**
> 
> - The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 5 * 104]`.
> - `0 <= Node.val <= 5 * 104`
> - The tree is guaranteed to be **complete**.

# Intuition

# Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def countNodes(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        if root is None:
            return 0

        left = root
        right = root

        l_depth = 0
        r_depth = 0

        while left is not None:
            l_depth += 1
            left = left.left
        
        while right is not None:
            r_depth += 1
            right = right.right
        
        if l_depth == r_depth:
            return pow(2, l_depth) - 1
        
        return 1 + self.countNodes(root.left) + self.countNodes(root.right)
```
