>[!Problem]
>Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.
> If there is no common prefix, return an empty string `""`.
> 
> **Example 1:**
> 
> **Input:** strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
> **Output:** "fl"
> 
> **Example 2:**
> 
> **Input:** strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
> **Output:** ""
> **Explanation:** There is no common prefix among the input strings.
> 
> **Constraints:**
> 
> - `1 <= strs.length <= 200`
> - `0 <= strs[i].length <= 200`
> - `strs[i]` consists of only lowercase English letters if it is non-empty.

# Solution
- **Time Complexity**: $O(nl + l)$ ($l$ is the length of the largest string)
	- Insertion if $O(nl)$ but getting LCP is only $O(l)$
- **Space Complexity**: $O(nl)$

## Intuition
- Build a  [[Trie\|Trie]] and add below method to it
- Traverse through trie as long as there is only one child and not end of word
- Keep adding that one child to a result string

```python
class Solution:
    def longestCommonPrefix(self, strs: List[str]) -> str:
        
        def getLcp(self) -> str:
			curr: TrieNode = self.root
			lcp: str = ""

			while curr:
				if len(curr.children) > 1 or curr.endOfWord:
					return lcp
				char = list(curr.children)[0]
				lcp += char
				curr = curr.children[char]
			
			return lcp
```
