> [!Problem]
> Given a `m x n` `grid` filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right, which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.
> 
> **Note:** You can only move either down or right at any point in time.
> 
> **Example 1:**
> 
> ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/05/minpath.jpg)
> 
> **Input:** grid = [[1,3,1],[1,5,1],[4,2,1\|1,3,1],[1,5,1],[4,2,1]]
> **Output:** 7
> **Explanation:** Because the path 1 → 3 → 1 → 1 → 1 minimizes the sum.
> 
> **Example 2:**
> 
> **Input:** grid = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6\|1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
> **Output:** 12
> 
> **Constraints:**
> 
> - `m == grid.length`
> - `n == grid[i].length`
> - `1 <= m, n <= 200`
> - `0 <= grid[i][j] <= 200`

# Intuition

# Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def minPathSum(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:

        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])

        if m == 1 and n == 1:
            return grid[0][0]
        if m == 1:
            return sum(grid[0][:])
        if n == 1:
            value = 0
            for i in range(m):
                value += grid[i][0]
            return value

        prev_row = [float("inf")] * n
        prev_row[0] = grid[0][0]
        for j in range(1, n):
            prev_row[j] = prev_row[j - 1] + grid[0][j]
        
        curr_row = [float("inf")] * n
        curr_row[0] = prev_row[0] + grid[1][0]

        # print(prev_row, curr_row)
        for i in range(1, m):
            for j in range(n):
                if j == 0:
                    curr_row[j] = prev_row[j] + grid[i][j]
                else:
                    curr_row[j] = min(curr_row[j - 1], prev_row[j]) + grid[i][j]
            curr_row, prev_row = prev_row, curr_row
        
        return prev_row[-1]
