>[!Problem]
>Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid `grid` which represents a map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return _the number of islands_.
> An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.
> 
> **Example 1:**
> 
> **Input:** grid = [
>   ["1","1","1","1","0"],
>   ["1","1","0","1","0"],
>   ["1","1","0","0","0"],
>   ["0","0","0","0","0"]
> ]
> **Output:** 1
> 
> **Example 2:**
> 
> **Input:** grid = [
>   ["1","1","0","0","0"],
>   ["1","1","0","0","0"],
>   ["0","0","1","0","0"],
>   ["0","0","0","1","1"]
> ]
> **Output:** 3
> 
> **Constraints:**
> 
> - `m == grid.length`
> - `n == grid[i].length`
> - `1 <= m, n <= 300`
> - `grid[i][j]` is `'0'` or `'1'`.

# Solution
- **Time Complexity**:
- **Space Complexity**: 
## Intuition
- Use disjoint set data structure on the grid cells with value as "1"
- Only need to check on next row/col since previous ones are covered in the loop
- Finally, find the parent cells of the grid cells with "1", and put into a set to find unique islands
- The first loop leaves the data structure in a state where the cells still do not point to their absolute parents. Running the loop again and calling find on those cells corrects it

    def numIslands(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        class UnionFind:
            def __init__(self, size: int):
                self.parent = list(range(size))
            
            def find(self, key: int) -> int:
                if self.parent[key] == key:
                    return key
                
                return self.find(self.parent[key])
            
            def union(self, key1: int, key2: int) -> None:
                self.parent[self.find(key1)] = self.find(key2)
        
        m = len(grid)
        n = len(grid[0])

        uf = UnionFind(m * n)

        for row in range(m):
            for col in range(n):
                if grid[row][col] == "0":
                    continue

                if row + 1 < m and grid[row + 1][col] == "1":
                    uf.union((row * n + col), ((row + 1) * n + col))
                
                if col + 1 < n and grid[row][col + 1] == "1":
                    uf.union((row * n + col), (row * n + col + 1))
    
        islands = set()

        for row in range(m):
            for col in range(n):
                if grid[row][col] == "1":
                    islands.add(uf.find(row * n + col))

        return len(islands)
