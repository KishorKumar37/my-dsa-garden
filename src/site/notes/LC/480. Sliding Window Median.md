>[!Problem]
>The **median** is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size of the list is even, there is no middle value. So the median is the mean of the two middle values.
> - For examples, if `arr = [2,3,4]`, the median is `3`.
> - For examples, if `arr = [1,2,3,4]`, the median is `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`.
> 
> You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. There is a sliding window of size `k` which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the `k` numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.
> 
> Return _the median array for each window in the original array_. Answers within `10-5` of the actual value will be accepted.

> **Example 1:**
> 
> **Input:** nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], k = 3
> **Output:** [1.00000,-1.00000,-1.00000,3.00000,5.00000,6.00000]

# Solution
- **Time Complexity**: $O()$
- **Space Complexity**: $O()$
## Intuition
- This problem is similar to [[LC/295. Find Median from Data Stream\|295. Find Median from Data Stream]] problem, the difference is that we also need to support deleting elements as we move the window
- Since the total number of elements is known at start, we can just add half the number of elements in each. Push everything in lower half first and then pop half the elements from it into upper half
- Maintain size of upperHalf > lowerHalf
- Once the window moves by one step, we need to check which half it is a part of and remove it. But this operation is costly
- Here there is an optimization. The removed element will affect our calculation only if it is at the top ie: candidate for median
- If it's somewhere in the middle, the median only depends on count and we are anyway going to balance the counts after remove and add operation. If we can't remove now, we will lazily delete it later when it comes to the top
	- If remove element is at the top of either half remove it, else mark it in a map for lazy deletion
	- Maintain balance variable to indicate the imbalance in number of elements between the halves. If element is in upper half, we need to balance later by moving one element from lower to upper half, vice versa. 
	- Push the new element in correct half and adjust the balance variable accordingly
	- Now balance by moving one element from lower to upper or vice versa as necessary. Even if magnitude of balance is 2, one element swap between halves is enough to correct the balance
	- At this point, the balance ensures median calculation for next iteration is correct
	- Now we lazily delete by checking if the top of either halves are marked in the map for deletion

#doubt Does lazy deletion not introduce imbalances
