> [!Problem]
> Given a string `s`, find the length of the **longest** **substring** without duplicate characters.
> 
> **Example 1:**
> 
> **Input:** s = "abcabcbb"
> **Output:** 3
> **Explanation:** The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
> 
> **Example 2:**
> 
> **Input:** s = "bbbbb"
> **Output:** 1
> **Explanation:** The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
> 
> **Example 3:**
> 
> **Input:** s = "pwwkew"
> **Output:** 3
> **Explanation:** The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
> Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
> 
> **Constraints:**
> 
> - `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104`
> - `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

# Solution
- **Time Complexity**: $O(n)$
	- Both pointers move in same direction and only once, at max gives $2n$
- **Space Complexity**: $O(n)$

## Intuition
- Brute force requires $O(n^2)$ with nested loops
- Since this is a #substring problem, we can solve using [[Two Pointer#Window Type\|Two Pointer#Window Type]]
- Use a [[Hashing#Hash Set\|Hashing#Hash Set]] to insert and quickly check if character is repeated
- Increment the right of window until repeated character is encountered, once repeated move left of window till this repeated character is removed
- Both pointers move in same direction and only once, at max gives $2n$

>[!Warning]
>We can't use dictionary to directly get index of previous repetition because all intermediate characters between the 2 repetitions also need to be removed

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        if not s:
            return 0
        if len(s) == 1:
            return 1
        i = 0

        chars = set()
        max_len = 0

        for j in range(len(s)):
            while s[j] in chars:
                chars.remove(s[i])
                i += 1

            chars.add(s[j])
            max_len = max(max_len, j - i + 1)
        
        return max_len
```
