>[!Problem]
>Given a string `s`, rearrange the characters of `s` so that any two adjacent characters are not the same.
> Return _any possible rearrangement of_ `s` _or return_ `""` _if not possible_.
> 
> **Example 1:**
> 
> **Input:** s = "aab"
> **Output:** "aba"
> 
> **Example 2:**
> 
> **Input:** s = "aaab"
> **Output:** ""
> 
> **Constraints:**
> 
> - `1 <= s.length <= 500`
> - `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

# Solution
- **Time Complexity**: $O(n \log{k})$ (where $k$ is the number of unique characters)
- **Space Complexity**: $O($n)$
## Intuition
- Use collections.Counter to get frequencies
- We want to iterate from most common to least common and add it to result array, repetitively until all elements are exhausted
- The optimal way is to alternate the first 2 highest frequency ones, until one of their frequencies equals that of the 3rd one. Then first highest will alternate with second /third highest and so on
- Use negative of count to build a max heap
- To get the optimal behavior, pop the highest freq one and hold it in a prev char and count variable until next char is done, then put it back in
```python
class Solution:
    def reorganizeString(self, s: str) -> str:
        counter = Counter(s)
        max_heap = [(-count, char) for char, count in counter.most_common()]
        del counter

        heapq.heapify(max_heap)

        result = []
        prev_count, prev_char = 0, ""

        while max_heap:
            print(max_heap)
            curr_count, curr_char = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
            result.append(curr_char)

            if prev_count < 0:
                heapq.heappush(max_heap, (prev_count, prev_char))
            
            curr_count += 1
            prev_count, prev_char = curr_count, curr_char
        
        if len(result) != len(s):
            return ""
        
        return "".join(result)
```
